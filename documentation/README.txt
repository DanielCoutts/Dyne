DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

Regular commits:
  - Every time you add some functionality do a commit and sync your changes.
  - Committing as regularly as possible ensures that any conflicts are quickly resolved.
  - Commits can never be too regular. If you add a single line of code and it works, pushing
    the change will not have any negative effects. Committing changes as large chunks can
    cause issues with multiple people making changes simultaneously.

Working code:
  - Never commit broken code. Different team members will often be working on different
    sections of the app at the same time. Ensuring your changes will not break existing
    functionality is important, so all changes must be tested immediately before any commit.
  - If there are any conflict when syncing your code, you are responsible for reviewing
    them, making any necessary changes, and committing a working solution. You may need to
    communicate with the author of the conflicting code in order to find a solution.
