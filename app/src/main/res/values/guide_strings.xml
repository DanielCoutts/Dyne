    <string name="guide1_s1i1">Herbs and spices are essential flavouring ingredients. Most herbs are produced from the leaves and stems of a variety of plants. Spices, however, can come from plantsâ€™ roots, seeds, bark, buds or berries.

It is best to keep these essential dry herbs on hand: basil, bay leaves, dill, marjoram, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, tarragon and thyme. Dried herbs have a more intense, concentrated flavour than fresh herbs. Crush dried herbs between your fingers before adding them to a dish to get the most flavour.

Fresh herbs have a brighter, lighter and fresher taste than dried ones; however, they are best purchased fresh, refrigerated and used within a few days. As a rule, if a recipe calls for one tablespoon of dried herbs you should use two tablespoons when using fresh.</string>
